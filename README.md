It was a long, long summer. After years of acquiring knowledge, falling asleep over books, drinking liters of coffee to stay awake, enduring exams, building projects, and failing twice as often—suddenly, it was over. There was nothing more left to achieve. As she walked out of the room where the master’s thesis defense had just ended, it felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted. And she wondered:
_What should I do now? What should I do, now that I am free?_

So, she did everything. Without care for the world, she could finally wake up when she wanted, seize the day, and make choices on her own terms. She was the ruler of her time. And what does one do with such power? The answer was obvious: indulge in the things she had long denied herself—things she secretly knew she wouldn't be able to stop once she started.

It began innocently. Or maybe not. It began big. Just her, a PS5, dimmed lights, and a Polish heart full of love for The Witcher 3. From White Orchard to Velen, partying in Novigrad and sailing across Skellige, she roamed freely. No villager went unhelped, no monster unslain, no smuggler’s cache untouched. One by one, the question marks vanished. Side quests, Witcher contracts, treasure hunts—all crossed off.

But as the quests disappeared, a strange hunger stirred. She wanted more. Watching the mages and magical beings hide in Novigrad, longing to stay in a place that didn’t welcome them, Geralt began to wonder: _Where is my home?_ After exploring the cliffs of Skellige and battling sirens, he returned—on horseback—to something resembling home.

Yet, something was missing. The Witcher was breathtaking—but she could not shape the world. She craved warmth, nature, and a place that was truly hers. That’s when the controller transformed in her hands. The joysticks shifted. A retro TV blinked into her palms. The cheery tune announced her arrival: a new life, on a deserted island.

She built herself from nothing. She paid her debts, gathered shells, caught bugs, and picked fruit. She built a house with yellow lights, fish-themed wallpaper, a crafting corner, and a cozy nook with music playing from a record player.

One day, lounging on a beach towel, sunglasses on, she reached into her pocket—only to find a rotten vegetable. Shocked. Bewildered. An exclamation mark hovered above her head. Of course. Life isn’t just fields of flowers and sunny beaches. She had been digging holes, shaking trees, waiting for the stalk market to rise—while real life crept closer.

In reality, she had a job waiting. A full-time job. One she had worked toward. One she wanted. Not to shame island decorators and neighborhood beautifiers—but this would be something else. Still, the job hadn’t begun. And before responsibility rolled in, she had time.

Not time for Netflix until 3 a.m., not for popcorn-fueled binge sessions, not even for more games. She had time for something far more thrilling: doing something without being paid.

You may have heard of the overjustification effect—when getting paid to do what you love starts to dull your love for it. What if, in the years to come, she would look in the mirror and think: Would I still do this, if no one paid me?

So instead of worrying about the future, she chose to live in the present. To do the things she loves, while no one was watching. While no one was paying.

She decided to write code.
